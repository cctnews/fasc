　　这朵恋情之花，就如许高耸地开到了荼蘼。花期太短，民心太薄弱。还来不迭灿烂宏大。废除花未全开月为圆的矇眬美，一下子犹如就跌入了破败，变的残破不全，就像一颗被撕成很碎很碎的心，再也没辙拼出时髦的摸样。世上有太多信誓旦旦的相爱，却鲜有坚韧不拔的相守。
暗恋这条路，究竟走的太难。看着尔等的快乐，我的浅笑简直是有些勉强，说不留心，不妒忌，本来是假的，有年的爱好岂能说停止就停止，说遮蔽就遮蔽。我还牢记，你曾坐在我的后桌，呜呜大睡是你的选修课，而我总会趁你和周公聚会时悄悄地用镜子倒映你的相貌，一笔一划地勾画在纸上。大概你长久不会领会，我有一个美术本，上头记载得满满都是你，用饭，安排，发愣，深思几何日子，我都是悄悄看着这个美术本，想着现在的你在做什么，想设想着便笑了。其时，就连想起你也是一种痛快。其时的你还没有女伙伴，而我究竟有些笨拙，还不领会有一种心动叫作爱好，不过简单的想要和你一道搭伴。其时咱们认定对方是伙伴，而后一道猖獗芳华。咱们一道逃课去吃烧烤，而后回校一道被叫到接待室挨批，教授气的浓烟滚滚，我两却还在教授眼睑下面俯首做目光交谈，一点也没有受训的自愿。咱们的相与形式不是长久的宁静，你争我吵的日子从未在咱们的时间里淡薄。用饭时我指责木耳被你训，过强的自豪心不承诺我示弱，纵然我领会你说的都是为我好，可我仍旧感触委曲，第一次咱们不欢而散。第二天你照常和我谈天，恍若之前的辩论不过我的错觉。联系回复后，咱们才发端往事重提，即是那次咱们相约不妨有辩论，不不妨有中断。
　　在初中学过并教过陶渊明的《桃花源记》和郭沫若的《天上的街市》。一篇古代散文，一篇现代诗歌，都是虚构的社会理想，一个在“绝境”，一个在天上，却表达了作者以及广大人民群众对美好社会的向往和追去，但是在旧中国，政治黑暗，战乱频繁，民不聊生，这种社会理想只不过是一种虚无的幻想，是根本无法实现的。
This season in the morning, the mountains filled with a thick fog.
Fog that was not enough clear vision become more narrow, almost can not view several paces of scenery, so, when such a straw man stood there, you have to believe it's a real person, the birds and beasts are probably not so accurate thinking, they have a plenty of beyond human vision, but at first glance to see such a scarecrow, always unavoidably a scare.
Most generally make a thief guilty, Ruth, animals also Ruth.
I don't see what's in the garden vegetables, big green leaves covered with the ridge ridge, that dish is not bad, at least not by the birds and beasts are visit several times, the scarecrow still play a role.
In nature, many of the most profound truth, often can use the most simple language to express.
Paul gauguin in tower island amorous feelings of the west embankment in the series of paintings, a picture is a scarecrow, just the scarecrow look a bit edgy, colorful clothes with a large Mexican hat, impressive.
My friends in the city of an art house created a straw man to see his work, is a bit different, but the surreal style "scarecrow" what all don't like in the true sense of the scarecrow, pour a little bit like the city the cynicism of the idle or hippies.
Standing in large living room, so a "scarecrow" works, it was kind of strange feeling.
It did not master mind, it doesn't feel, it is a dead skins, weird modelling makes it is nothing to aesthetics, with the exquisite luxuriant decorate house exist at the same time, very harmonious.
Only on the scarecrow in fields, that's what it was a good thing.
Scarecrow beauty is that it didn't mind, it doesn't like people everywhere it the loom, the fortification and everywhere carefully, make the world a maze or trap.
When the wind blows out, see it swung, the appearance of serious, was in stitches.
People's handling are usually not bundle and pole, with a rope.
Up the hill cutting wood, the wood cut well, and they will be a large bundle of wood is placed horizontally on the ground, the rope double fold the shop in the middle of the wood, in the left and right sides, in a circular HuoKou, set on both sides of the shoulder, a pull rope, then HuoKou firmly set on both sides of the shoulder, and of course the HuoKou is exquisite technology, the average person is not playing.
As a result, the bundle of sticks, and neatly back on the back, is to steep slopes, deep wellknown ditch without any problem.
The bundle of sticks like marching backpack, close to in the body, foolproof.
Because of a go out, we must under the hill, m people back to other things, are all in this way.
So general m people think: "as long as there is a rope, no move don't go."
The rope has become people's war to fight of weapons.
